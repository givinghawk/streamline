# Creating Custom Presets with the Preset Wizard

## What is the Preset Wizard?

The Preset Wizard is a step-by-step tool that helps you create custom encoding presets tailored to your specific needs. Whether you want to optimize videos for YouTube, create archival-quality files, or compress videos for mobile devices, the Preset Wizard guides you through all the options without requiring technical knowledge of FFmpeg.

## Why Use Custom Presets?

While Streamline includes many built-in presets, you might want to create your own when:

- You need specific quality settings for a particular use case
- You want to optimize for a specific device or platform
- You have unique requirements (e.g., specific resolution, bitrate)
- You want to save time by reusing your favorite settings
- You need to share consistent settings with your team

## Getting Started

### Opening the Preset Wizard

1. Click the **Presets** tab (üì¶ icon) in Streamline
2. Click the **"Create Preset"** button
3. The Preset Wizard opens with a 6-step process

### The 6 Steps

The wizard walks you through creating your preset in a logical order:

**Step 1: Basic Information** - Name your preset and describe what it's for  
**Step 2: Video Basics** - Choose codec, quality, and encoding speed  
**Step 3: Video Advanced** - Fine-tune resolution, bitrate, and codec settings  
**Step 4: Audio Settings** - Configure audio codec, quality, and channels  
**Step 5: Advanced Options** - HDR, filters, subtitles, and performance  
**Step 6: Review & Save** - Preview your settings and save or export

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Basic Information

**What You'll Enter:**

- **Preset Name** - Give it a clear, descriptive name
  - Examples: "YouTube 1080p", "Mobile Optimized", "Archival H.265"
  
- **Category** - Choose what type of preset this is
  - **Video** - For video files
  - **Audio** - For audio-only files
  - **Image** - For image conversion
  
- **Description** - Explain what this preset is for
  - Example: "High quality encoding for YouTube uploads at 1080p with good compression"
  
- **Output Format** - Choose the container format
  - **MP4** - Most compatible, works everywhere
  - **MKV** - Supports all features, larger file sizes
  - **WebM** - Web optimized, good for streaming
  - **MOV** - Apple ecosystem
  - **AVI** - Legacy format, maximum compatibility

**Tips:**
- Use descriptive names that include codec and quality (e.g., "H.264 High Quality 1080p")
- Write descriptions that explain the use case, not just technical details
- Choose MP4 for maximum compatibility unless you have specific needs

### Step 2: Video Settings (Basic)

**What You'll Configure:**

**Video Codec** - The compression method for video
- **H.264 (x264)** - Universal compatibility, good quality
- **H.265 (x265)** - Better compression, smaller files, newer devices
- **Hardware Encoders** - Faster encoding using your GPU
  - NVENC (NVIDIA)
  - QSV (Intel)
  - VideoToolbox (Apple)
  - AMF (AMD)

**Quality (CRF)** - Lower numbers = better quality
- **18-20** - Near-lossless, archival quality (large files)
- **21-23** - Excellent quality, recommended for most uses
- **24-28** - Good quality, smaller files
- **29+** - Lower quality, very small files

**Encoding Speed** - How much time to spend encoding
- **Ultrafast** - Very quick, larger files
- **Fast/Medium** - Balanced
- **Slow/Slower** - Takes longer, smaller files, better quality
- **Veryslow** - Maximum compression (very slow)

**Hardware Acceleration** - Use your GPU for faster encoding
- Only available if your computer has compatible hardware
- Automatically detected by Streamline

**Tips:**
- Start with H.264 if unsure - it works on all devices
- Use CRF 23 for a good balance of quality and file size
- Use "medium" or "slow" preset for best results
- Enable hardware acceleration if available for much faster encoding

### Step 3: Video Settings (Advanced)

**When to Use:**
- You need a specific resolution or frame rate
- You want precise control over file size (bitrate)
- You're optimizing for a specific platform or device

**Resolution Scaling**
- Choose from common resolutions (4K, 1080p, 720p, etc.)
- Or enter custom width/height
- Leave blank to keep original resolution

**Frame Rate**
- 24 fps - Film look
- 30 fps - Standard video
- 60 fps - Smooth motion
- Leave blank to keep original

**Bitrate Control**
- Specify exact bitrate for predictable file sizes
- Higher bitrate = better quality but larger files
- Useful for streaming platforms with size limits

**Advanced Codec Settings**
- **Profile** - Compatibility level (use "high" for modern devices)
- **Level** - Technical compatibility setting (usually automatic)
- **Tune** - Optimize for content type (film, animation, etc.)
- **Pixel Format** - Color depth (yuv420p for compatibility)

**GOP Structure**
- **Keyframe Interval** - Seekability vs compression (default: 250)
- **B-frames** - Compression efficiency (default: 3)

**Tips:**
- Skip this step if you're happy with defaults
- Use 1080p (1920x1080) for YouTube/web
- Set bitrate only if you have specific file size requirements
- Leave advanced codec settings alone unless you know what they do

### Step 4: Audio Settings

**Audio Codec** - Choose how audio is compressed
- **AAC** - Universal, good quality (recommended)
- **MP3** - Maximum compatibility, slightly lower quality
- **Opus** - Best quality/size ratio, modern devices
- **FLAC** - Lossless (very large files)

**Audio Bitrate** - Quality of audio
- **64-96 kbps** - Speech, podcasts
- **128 kbps** - Standard music quality
- **192-256 kbps** - High quality music
- **320 kbps** - Maximum MP3/AAC quality

**Channels**
- **Mono** - Single channel, podcasts
- **Stereo** - Standard two-channel audio
- **5.1/7.1** - Surround sound

**Sample Rate**
- **44.1 kHz** - CD quality
- **48 kHz** - Video standard (recommended)
- **96/192 kHz** - High-resolution audio

**Tips:**
- Use AAC at 192 kbps for video - it's the best balance
- MP3 at 128 kbps is fine for most music
- Keep original sample rate if unsure (leave blank)
- Stereo is sufficient for most content

### Step 5: Advanced Options

**HDR & Color**
- Configure HDR (High Dynamic Range) if your source is HDR
- Most users can skip this section
- Only relevant for HDR content from cameras or streaming

**Video Filters**
- **Deinterlace** - Fix interlaced video (old camcorders)
- **Denoise** - Reduce video noise/grain
- **Custom Filters** - Advanced FFmpeg filters

**Subtitles**
- **Copy Subtitles** - Include subtitle tracks from source
- **Burn Subtitles** - Hardcode subtitles into video

**Container Options**
- **Copy Metadata** - Keep title, date, camera info
- **Fast Start** - Optimize for web streaming (recommended for web)

**Performance**
- **Thread Count** - How many CPU cores to use (automatic is best)
- **Two-Pass Encoding** - Better quality at target bitrate (slower)

**Custom Arguments**
- Add raw FFmpeg commands if you're an advanced user
- Not recommended for beginners

**Tips:**
- Enable "Fast Start" if uploading to web/streaming
- Copy metadata to preserve file information
- Skip video filters unless you have specific issues
- Leave thread count automatic for best performance

### Step 6: Review & Save
